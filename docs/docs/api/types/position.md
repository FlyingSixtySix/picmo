# `Position`

For popup pickers, the position of the picker is controlled by the `position` property.

## Fixed position

The picker can be given a fixed position on screen. A fixed position has up to four properties, defining its position relative to the viewport:

- `top`
- `bottom`
- `left`
- `right`

## Relative position

The picker can also be placed relative to another element on screen. This is a string value. Valid values are:

- `auto-end`
- `auto-start`
- `auto`
- `bottom-end`
- `bottom-start`
- `bottom`
- `left-end`
- `left-start`
- `left`
- `right-end`
- `right-start`
- `right`
- `top-end`
- `top-start`
- `top`
