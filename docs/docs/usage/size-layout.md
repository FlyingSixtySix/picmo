# Size and layout

## Grid size

The emojis in the picker are laid out in a grid. By default, the visible grid is 8 columns by 6 rows. This can be changed by specifying the [`emojisPerRow`](../api/types/picker-options#emojisperrow-number) and [`visibleRows`](../api/types/picker-options#visiblerows-number) properties in [`PickerOptions`](../api/types/picker-options).

## Emoji size

The size of the individual emojis in the grid can also be changed. The default size is `1.8em`. This can be changed by specifying the [`emojiSize`](../api/types/picker-options#emojisize-string) property in [`PickerOptions`](../api/types/picker-options). This can be any valid CSS size value.
