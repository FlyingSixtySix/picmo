# Emoji variants

Many emojis support multiple variants. Typically this is different skin tones, but in some cases can be other variations (hair color, gender, etc.).

## Variant popup

If an emoji that has variants is selected in the picker, the available variants are displayed (along with the original emoji).

When a variant is selected, the popup will close and the selected variant will be emitted.

## Disabling variants

If you do not want to show variants in the picker, specify the `showVariants: false` option.
